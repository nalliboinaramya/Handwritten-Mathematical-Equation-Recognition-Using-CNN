# Handwritten-Mathematical-Equation-Recognition-Using-CNN



Handwritten Mathematical Equation Recognition and Solving Using Convolution Neural Networks
we developed a user friendly Flask application that takes an image mathematical equation or equation written on canvas , recognize the equation using Convolution Neural Network and present the user with required solution.Since mathematics itself is a very wide field therefore, only a subset of these mathematical symbols is considered in this paper which are digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, รท), characters(y).
